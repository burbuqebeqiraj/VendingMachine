# VendingMachine

The Vending Machine is a console application that has been developed to perform several key functions, such as: 
- inserting coins
- canceling the process after coins have been inserted
- checking the inserted coins
- displaying the available products for purchase based on the inserted coins and product stock
- selecting a product to purchase
- canceling the process after a product has been chosen

The application allows for returning change after a purchase has been made, returning money after the process has been canceled, displaying the price of the purchased product after it has been obtained, as well as the stock of the selected product.

Additionally, all these functions have been tested both automatically and manually.
